[B][SIZE="4"]Turbo ROM is a custom Android ROM based on the latest Android Marshmallow (6.0.1_r61). Sourced from a straight AOSP/CAF base, the ROM is now extremely feature rich and has lots of customization options. My ([MENTION=6755930]Yoshi_Guy[/MENTION]) goal with this ROM is to create a ROM with as many customization options and possible while still being stable. In addition, the ROM uses OMS/Substratum for theming with full DayNight support.[/SIZE][/B]
