[B][SIZE="4"]Turbo ROM is a custom Android ROM based on the latest Android Marshmallow (6.0.1_r22). Sourced from a straight AOSP/CAF base, the ROM is now extremely feature rich and has lots of customization options. My (@Yoshi_Guy) goal with this ROM is to create a ROM with as many customization options and possible while still being stable. In addition, the ROM uses RRO/Layers for theming with full DayNight support. SuperSU is pre-installed along with ViPER4Android.[/SIZE][/B]
